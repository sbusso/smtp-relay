SMTP Receipts is a working SMTP server that will act as a relay, inserting
tracking data into your message so you can see when your recipient opens it.

It was originally deployed in the productionized consumer app MailReceipts
(www.mailreceipts.com), but the original authors (Thatcher Clay and Jon
Hyman) decided to release it to the wild as a) a working example of a custom
SMTP server implemented ontop of Twisted, and b) a viable relay server
for those wishing to build their own SMTP relays.
